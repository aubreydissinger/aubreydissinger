:::{#me}


I am currenty a Ph.D student in Marine Biology at the University of New Hampshire. I earned a B.S. in Biology from Kutzown University and a M.S. in Zoology from Southern Illinois University. My master’s thesis focused on the relationship between social environment and nutrition in fish. Specifically, my research investigated the effects of isolation on feeding behavior.

My current research focuses on the effects of soybean meal based diets on the intestinal health of fish and methods of mitigating diet-induced inflammation. My research aims to improve utilization of plant-based diets to promote more sustainable and cost-effective methods of raising fish.
